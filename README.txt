1) Introduction 

This program is a simple touchscreen-enabled calculator. 
It also recognizes dates and times and allows the user to perform 
operations on dates and times.

Examples:

Dates 

3/15/1971 - 0 = 44.663 (currently 44 years old, zero is magic for "now")
3/15/1971 - 9/8/2016 = 45.5178 (will be 45 years old on 9/8/16)
3/15/1971 - 5/2/1983 = 12.1397 (was 12 years old on 5/2/83)

Times

1:15:23 + 3:45 = 01:19:08
1:19:08 รท 9.32057 = 00:08:29 (15K runners pace per mile)

The screen is divided into three areas, lower right area is the keypad 
which functions on touchscreen, the upper right area is the input 
display, and the left area is the report.

The report has three columns, "OP", "DATA" and "RES". The "OP" column
shows the operation (ie, +, -, * or รท), "DATA" shows the input information,'
and "RES" shows the result of the operation. The operation is always 
performed on the current "DATA" and preceeding "RES" value, therefor 
will have a running tally. If you wish to start fresh, press the NEW 
button on the keypad.

4) Building the program

GNU/Linux

# qmake
# make
# cp nugget /usr/bin

FreeBSD

# /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
# make
# cp nugget /usr/local/bin


5) Running the program

# nugget

The program will launch full screen by default. 
To launch the program in "normal screen view", ie not fullscreen, use 
the command line parameter "S"

# nugget S


6) Caveats

1.	REV/DEL/BACK can be confusing.

2.	"/" on keyboard is "รท", hold shift plus "/" for date seperator.

3.	If you click on the report area, keyboard entry may not function as
	intended. Click on the keypad to resume keyboard entry.
	
4.	Dates are in USA format, m/d/Y. May use system locale in the future.

5.	Operations performed on times do not use tenths, ie 1:13:01.7

6.	Presently use numeric 10-key or touchscreen. To be fixed in future.

7.	Times may be added or subtracted. Times may be divided by a number. 
	Other time operations may not function as desired.
	
8.	Result table copy is not currently implemented (future release).
